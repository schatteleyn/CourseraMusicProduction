          <h3>Dynamics Processors</h3>

          <h4>Dynamics processors overview: </h4>

            <p>
              A dynamic processor is something that outputs a signal, where the level of the outgoing signal is based on the level of the incoming signal. In other words, a loud signal coming in will come out differently than a quiet signal coming in. <br />
              The most common types of dyamics processors are the compressors, the expanders, the limiters and the gates. <br /><br />

              The following are the most commons dynamic processing controls.
            </p>

          <h4>Threshold: </h4>

            <p>
              The threshold control adjusts the level where the dynamic processor will start to work. <br />
              Reducing the threshold level means that more peaks of the signal will trigger the compressor to turn down the gain; increasing the threshold level means that an expander or gate will turn down more low-level signals.
            </p>

          <h4>Ratio: </h4>
            
            <p>
              The ratio control determines how much the signals that are being compressed or expanded will be turned down. <br /><br />

              For example, if a compressor has a 2:1 ratio, the compressor will turn down the gain so that if the input signal is 2dB above the threshold level, the output increases only one dB. If the input signal is 4 dB above the threshold, the gain will be turned down so that the output only rises 2 dB above the threshold (a 2 to 1 ratio).<br /><br />

              Expanders also have ratios. An expansion ratio of 1:2 means that if the input signal drops 1 dB below the threshold level and the gain will be reduced so that the output is 2 dB below the threshold level.  If an expander has a very high expansion ratio, it becomes a gate. 
            </p>

          <h4>Attack and release times: </h4>

            <p>
             The attack time is how fast the dynamics processor will react to a signal crossing the threshold level, going up. In a compressor it is the time it takes the compressor to reduce gain on a high-level passage. On an expander, it is the time that the expander takes to restore full gain after the audio level comes up after a low level passage.<br />
             The release time is how fast the dynamics processor will react to a signal crossing the threshold level, going down. In a compressor, it is the time it takes the unit to restore gain after the high-level passage is over with. In an expander, it is the time the expander takes to turn down a low level passage (below the threshold level). <br /><br />

             Release times should be adjusted for the frequency and how percussive the signal is.  Compressors for bass signals must not be set to a very short release time or the gain will be changed within one cycle, causing distortion.  Generally speaking, the fastest release time that sounds natural is the best for both compression and expansion.
